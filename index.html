# Why Would I Want

Assessing the suitability of development projects for your needs is difficult. It is exacerbated by developers tendency to document *what* their project is, but not explain under which circumstances that project would be right for you. 

WhyWouldIWant is currently just notes - in open learning spirit - of various open source projects and my assesment of why I'd like to use them. 

I'm primarily a front-end javascript developer. 

Note: WIIAHDIGMT stands for "What is it & how does it give me that".

### Universal Javascript
See [Isomorphic Javascript](#isomorphic-javasript).

### Isomorphic Javascript
*Why*: Because you need fast initial page loads, but still want a rich client-side application. 

*WIIAHDIGMT*: Javascript that can be run serverside to pre-render a page, send that, and then send same(ish) code to render client side after the fact. See [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_JavaScript).
