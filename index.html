# WhyWouldIWant

The difficulty of assessing development projects for your needs is exacerbated by developers tendency to document *what* their project is, but not explain under which circumstances that project would be right for you. 

WhyWouldIWant is not even close to the MVP idea. It's currently notes - in open learning spirit - of various open source projects and my assesment of why I'd like to use them.
